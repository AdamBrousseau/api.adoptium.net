# Testing

Tests rely on the data inside the `exampleRepositories` directory in order for tests to pass they must be signed. If 
you wish to modify test assets they need to be re-signed once they have been modified. The procedure would be as follows:

- Generate test keys
    - Look in the `exampleRepositories/keys` directory for scripts that detail generating keys
- Re-sign assets
    - Run `SignTestAssets` in the `adoptium-marketplace-utils` project.
